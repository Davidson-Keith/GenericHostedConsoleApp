# GenericHostConsole App

A simple demo Console App using the [.NET Generic Host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-8.0), providing:

- DI
- Configuration
- Logging

Modified by myself to:
- Fill out Serilog setup, config, and usage.
- Play with nested config settings. 
- Add a JSON array to config settings.
